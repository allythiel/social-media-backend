# Social Media Back End

This back end component is part of a pair that runs the Social Media Webpage for Basket Weavers. To run this component simply do the following in your terminal:
# npm start

The Social Media project was a group project where we were tasked with creating our own web page with a theme for users to come together. This back end holds the information for users (new and old), updated user profile information, user feeds, user friends and friend requests, as well as any user comments. This back end should be started prior to starting the Social Media Front End. 

In this project, there were multiple technologies used including:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Nodemon
- Mongoose
- Joi Validation
- Cors
- Config

The majority of this project was done through paired programming as we sat down to determine the methods our app would function once buliding out the front end, which included multiple days of working together as a team to find the common goal.
